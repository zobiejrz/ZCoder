# ZCoder
Before this project, I had trust issues. Now, I hide my deepest darkest secrets by converting the text in my files into binary, because I still have trust issues :-)

## Getting Started ##
I built this using java 11.0.1, and that's what you will need to use this. After downloading java and cloning the directory, open up a command prompt and navigate to the installation folder. To get the code running, all you need to do is this:
~~~~
javac ZCoder.java
java ZCoder
~~~~

## Contributing ##
If you want to further enable people to thinly veil text files from others, feel free to submit a pull request! This is a personal project I'm using as practice so I may decide to ignore you all together, but I'll keep tabs on requests to see if I want to make something happen.

## Issue Reporting ##
Again, this is a personal project, so I would love to waste time I don't have on debugging. Really, that's what I do with my time. Submit an issue and I'll take it from there.

## Acknowledgments ##
The goal of this wasn't to learn how to convert ascii into binary or binary into ascii, so I didn't. I copied and pasted two sources from online and you can find the links to those sources next to the functions I copied in ZCoder.java.
